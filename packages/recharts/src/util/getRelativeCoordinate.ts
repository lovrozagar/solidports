 * Computes relative element coordinates from mouse or touch event.
 *
 * The output coordinates are relative to the top-left corner of the active element (= currentTarget),
 * where the top-left corner is (0, 0).
 * Moving right, the x-coordinate increases, and moving down, the y-coordinate increases.
 *
 * The coordinates are rounded to the nearest integer and account for CSS transform scale.
 * So element that's scaled will return the same coordinates as element that's not scaled.
 *
 * In other words: you zoom in or out, numbers stay the same.
 *
 * This function works with both HTML elements and SVG elements.
 *
 * It works with both Mouse and Touch events.
 * For Touch events, it returns an array of coordinates, one for each touch point.
 * For Mouse events, it returns a single coordinate object.
 *
 * @since 3.8
 * @param event The mouse or touch event (works with both HTML and SVG elements)
 * @returns Coordinates relative to the top-left corner of the element. Single object for Mouse events, array of objects for Touch events.
